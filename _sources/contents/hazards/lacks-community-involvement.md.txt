## Description

This applies when technology is being produced without input from the community it is supposed to serve.

## Examples

__Example 1:__ Research into cures for Autism generally ([which are not wanted by Austistic people](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/14/autism-health)).

__Example 2:__ Samaritan's Radar app highlighted people who may be struggling to cope on Twitter, and was [withdrawn following wide criticism](https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/research-policy/internet-suicide/samaritans-radar/). 

__Example 3:__ [Algorithmic colonisation of Africa](https://script-ed.org/article/algorithmic-colonization-of-africa/)


## Safety Precautions

- Ask the people who the works is about if they want this kind of solution, and co-create or [co-produce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XF0GFDYw3E) research with them as partners.
- Test the effectiveness of the algorithm or technology for different marginalised groups.
- Consideration of issues of power, consent and trust.
