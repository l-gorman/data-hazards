# Examples of using the Data Hazards

Here we share a series of examples of how people have made use of the Data Hazards in their work.

## Teaching

[Holly Fraser](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/digital-health/people/current-students/holly-fraser/), University of Bristol, used the Data Hazards with MSc students studying Digital Health and Care for an AI and Ethics themed seminar. 

>The seminar went really well I thought, and the labels linked really well with the other ethics content in the course. I adapted the slides you provided to give an overview of the labels, and found some real life examples of the hazards (e.g. Boris Johnson blaming a ‘mutant algorithm’ for the A-Level results prediction fiasco back in 2020, instead of the government taking accountability), then asked the students to apply the labels to some real life projects. I used my PhD project as an example, and some other people from the Digital Health CDT kindly let me use their projects as well.
>
>I asked for some feedback at the end, and the students said they found the labels easy to use and seemed to understand the concepts really well. They all managed to apply multiple labels to the different projects, so I think the label imagery and the explanations worked well in the different research contexts. They had one comment on the label ‘High environmental use’, where they definitely understood the concept but weren’t sure how to measure high or low use, or what unit they would use to quantify it, which I thought was an interesting discussion point.
>
>The students worked in small groups (about 5 per group) which worked well, I think even pairs would have been fine too though.


## Self Assessment 

Natalie Zelenka used the Data Hazards in her thesis as part of the discussion of the ethical aspects of her work.
