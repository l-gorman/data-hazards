On this page you will find materials we have made to help people to use or apply the [Data Hazard labels](data-hazards). 
This includes a workshop format, a teaching/lecture based format, and an asychronous format which can be adapted to just be an individual exercise.

You are welcome to use any of the materials we share here, which (like all of our content) are available to use with a [CC-BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
This means, roughly, they can be re-used and adapted as long as you credit this repository. 

We are currently developing all these materials so please do get in touch with us through the [Contact](contact) tab above if you have any thoughts or examples of how you have used the materials! 
Alternatively if you have changes in mind that you would like to make then check out [How to contribute](contribute) - we always welcome new contributors!


## Ethos 

If you are using the Data Hazards, please keep in mind the ethos that they were intended to be used with. 
In summary, the Data Hazards exist to prompt discussion, reflection and thought. 
They are not a checkbox exercise, and there is no requirement for a group to come to a consensus. 
We hope that the Data Hazards discussion and reflective activities will help researchers be aware of a broader variety of potential ethical risks in tech projects, and that ethics is complex, situational and worth discussing.
This is discussed in more detail on the [About](about) page.
