# Working with project owners

## Who can be a project owner?
Anyone using statistics or data science in their work! 
We intend for the Data Hazards to be useful with all types of projects, including those still in their abstract phases. 

## What do the project owners need to do?
The main thing they need to prepare in advance is a description of their project, which is key to the workshop format. 
Here are some things we recommend their 5-minute talk includes:  
- The overall objective of the project
- Fairly detailed description of the variables in the dataset they are using (and what is not included)
- How and when the data was collected
- Any statistical/algorithmic methods being used
- Who has input on the project
- What outputs are expected, and how these will be shared

They also need to be prepared to answer questions about their project from the audience.
